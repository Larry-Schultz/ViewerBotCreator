# Viewer Bot Creator

This is a React application that can be used to create a manual bot using a series of dropdowns.

These dropdowns will dynamically populate a xml element, which can be applied to the botland portion of my
Viewer application.  The Botland config can be found here: https://github.com/Larry-Schultz/FFTB_Viewer/blob/master/src/main/resources/Botland.xml

This application uses MobX to power the dynamic portions of the application.  Info on MobX can be found here: https://mobx.js.org/README.html
